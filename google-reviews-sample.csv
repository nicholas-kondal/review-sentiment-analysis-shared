"After skiing in countries such as Japan and Australia, I can say with some certainty there is something odd here at Cadrona. On entering, we followed signs towards the main office, but after being ushered to a lower car park we ended up walking 200 metres in ski gear. The ticket office was hard to find when we finally arrived. Again at lunchtime, we had trouble finding the cafeteria and amenities. No scenic views from the cafe- we were in a black box! Enjoyed my day, a good run and friendly staff but I had to say there's some poor management with the journey to and from facilities. In terms of the facilities, the alpine experience is lost. Better parking and signage systems are needed. Very disorientating. three stars",a month ago

the snow is icy so when you're skiing your legs and skis vibrate and its quite uncomfortable,3 months ago
Best ski field in NZ. Great dining options + facilities. They've handled the covid restrictions brilliantly + should be commended for this as its not an easy task in some parts of a ski resort. Highly recommend.,a year ago
