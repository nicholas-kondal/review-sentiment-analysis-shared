2021,Aug,"Awesome slopes for all levels of experience. Really well set up, with the base area for rental/toilets/storage/cafe etc. Good ski lifts, plenty of options. While there's car parks, the road up there is a bit dicey when its snowing/icy, my advice is to use the town Snow Center bus service, which is fantastic! Dont bother driving!"
2021,Jul,"The Remarkables is a really wonderful day out if you are visiting Queenstown to ski or snowboard, the snow is definitely better there than at Coronet Peak if you’re struggling to choose. We had a snowboard lesson with Adam (I think!) and he was absolutely amazing. Our experience in the cafe area was not so good, except the barista’s - they are amazing, and make such good coffees! The manager, I think her name is Alex, was nothing but rude and abrupt whilst I was with my family, trying to rush us through the queue. It wasn’t a busy day and I felt her attitude was disgusting. Definitely would be bringing my own food and drinks on any future visits. Overall experience at the remarkables was great, smooth and consistent transport from town makes it easy to get there and back too so would definitely do this instead of risking driving up in bad conditions!"
2021,Jul,"We always thought the Remarkables was for advanced skiers, but there was a great mix for all levels. The snow was soft and perfect for our kids who were beginners. The double lane magic carpets were under cover too... a binus for cold kids."
2021,Aug,"Wow. Let me tell you about this lady Alexis in F&B. She is amazing. Her helpfulness just blew me away. I was just up there to drink a coffee, not even ski, and I watched her lead her team with such stern kindness it made my heart swell up. Then, I saw her slinging sangas at the ice bar the very next day! Is there nothing this woman can't do?! Jacinda who?! 10/10 would go back. Huge fan."
2021,Jul,"We tried skiing for the first time at the Remarkables and took the group lessons. On our second day, we were very fortunate to have Lewis Barton as our instructor. He was very experienced, gave excellent advice that was easy to follow and was incredible at building confidence. We progressed so much (and our confidence grew so much) under the guidance of Lewis. We would highly recommend Lewis for anyone looking to book private ski lessons."
2021,Jun,"Great for those a little more experienced ! There was plenty to do as a beginner eg. The lookout, restaurant, the beginners run. The snow quality was the best we had seen, a definite if going snowboarding"
2021,July,"Really poor organisation. When their lack of effective management results in a child with a broken wrist and a ruined holiday, with not a word out of NZSki. You realize that this company does not care for their clients. We booked 2 kids into the beginners ski school. It took over 30 mins just to receive the kids. We went for a ride and returned 30mins later to see that they had done nothing with the kids. Another run and I returned and could not find either kids. I found my 5yr old in tears in the kindy area as she was bored and nothing had been done. I eventually found someone to give her a push. A complete waste of money. The 8 yr old was also unsupervised and had fallen over trying to get into her skis. The result was a trip down to the hospital and x-rays and an arm on a cast. Day ruined. Holiday ruined. Naturally the kids were not interested in going back to the mountain which means that due to NZSki lack of management an expensive ski holiday was now ruined. To date, nobody from NZSki has responded to my complaint."
2021,April,"A spectacular drive in summer, with incredible views"
2020,September,"Great private lesson this morning with Ash. Good tips and some homework. Highly recommend him"
2020,September,"Good access from Queenstown. Well groomed slopes with varying degrees of difficulty. Good restaurant facilities. Friendly staff."
2021,Jul,"Ended up visiting the Remarkables when we weren't too sure what to expect. Lovely drive up the mountain and beautiful scenery. Ended up at the top car park and wandered to the ski field. We definitely aren't skiers but it was great to go there and it was buzzing with excitement. Saw a few cars get a bit stuck so wouldn't go there without chains."
2021,Jul,"As a non-skiing family who just wanted to give our kids some fun in the snow we thought a trip up to The Remarkables where they have tobogganing and a 'snow fun' area would be ideal...but sadly not. After misinterpreting the 'free shuttle bus from our carparks' we drove to their carpark (at the bottom of the hill) only to find that carpark required $15 from each of us to take the bus up...the same fare we could have paid in town. We then waited over 30 minutes for a bus, which arrived with only 2 empty seats (there were 4 of us). While that bus was collecting 2 passengers a totally empty bus drove past the rest of us (about 15 people) and went up the mountain EMPTY! After another 10 minutes a bus turned up and were on our way (after a delay when our barcodes couldn't be read by the driver's scanner, resulting in quite a lot of swearing in front of our kids...not impressed.) However the journey up was spectacular...great views. When we got to the top we collected our toboggans ($30 EACH...for the same kind you can get at Kmart for $20) and went to find the snow play / toboggan area. It took some finding, partly through really poor signage, but also because it's TINY. One miniscule toboggan run and NOTHING ELSE. Seriously, the run is about 40m long and 5m wide. My kids did it 3 or 4 times and that was enough. So, back down to the main building where we had a further $25 extracted for a can of soft drink, a coffee, a tea and 2 small portions of hot chips...all with the added bonus of needing to queue twice for more than 10 minutes each time (hot drinks are served from a different place to chips and soft drinks you see) The cafeteria (yes, that's the best way to describe it) was PACKED. Having finished our refreshments we felt it was probably time to leave. It was 1.30pm and we'd been told that's when the buses would start to go down the mountain. We got to the buses just before 1.30 and were told that the first bus would only be going to hotels in town (the fact that it was half empty and had to go through the carpark at the bottom of the hill was logic which escaped the driver, so our 1.30 bus eventually became a 2.10 bus. So, $145 for a family day out involving a bus ride, 400m on a toboggan and some underwhelming refreshments. I'm sure that if skiing is your thing then The Remarkables is a good place to spend a day. However, if it's not, don't believe the website that it's a great place for a family day trip. It feels like an exercise in emptying your wallet from start to finish and with really poorly organised fundamentals (transport, signage, food) thrown in for good measure."
2021,Jun,"Very good ski resort with magnificent views. Instructor Hannah is very good and patient. Good beginner area, went up to the Alta lift, one part is a bit steep, I slipped but was ok, needs more practice. Very busy on the mountain but still has room to ski well. All the staff is very helpful and store own ski on the mountain overnight."
2021,Jul,"Great ski field, Miro the instructor was terrific, encouraging but pushing us to get better and friendly and fun too. I’m so glad I did my very first lesson with him (after 30+ years of skiing). The experience in every way was superior to north island skiing options, from the short waits at the lifts to being able to get a table to sit at during lunchtime, to the well-designed buildings and traffic-flow and the mountain was amazing, best skiing, we loved it."
2021,Jun,"I went with my wife and daughter who is a beginner. The ski field is excellent for beginners, plenty of easy runs. The down side is there are 3 runs which join into 1, some people are moving very fast coming from the experience run into the beginner run. This was ok as there were not many people I would not like to be there when it’s busy. For the bus best go into Queenstown at the station and catch from there. Get there early, plenty of buses coming back."
2021,Jun,"Staff were so accomodating, empathetic & helpful! my daughter at start of lessons wanted to change from snowboarding to skiing: Nicky took over to assist. I slipped on slopes, fractured my wrist & response from staff Will & Will were amazing before releasing me to calming care of Dr Katie& med staff. Customer service fully refunded my lessons & lift passes without a fuss. So good!"
2021,Jul,"Worst resort in Nz. Do not go.90 mins wait to catch a bus up, even though they encourage you to catch it 45 min wait for any food Lifting don’t organise chairs to max capacity and lower queues Lessons teachers don’t care and just do the “easy play” with kids and don’t actually teach them anythingWhole place is totally unprepared for people and lacks care. Don’t bother visiting. I won’t ever return."
2020,Jul,"Hired a car and hired some chains. Thought I would do my bit for the struggling tourism sector to ""support local"". I had visited Coronet Peak a few years ago and a lovely British expat worker had graciously helped us fit the chains to our 2WD in the chain bay. As for Sunday 4th July 2020 at The Remarkables? A big fat NO. We were so excited to support the local economy and the guys being employed here post-COVID. Also excited to come skiing on opening weekend. But the rude and arrogant chain attendant (white, male, kiwi accent) kept shouting at us that we were doing it wrong and then kept returning to the road to direct other traffic. Refused to assist. So my questions to The Remarkables management are: 1. Why hire someone so rude to vulnerable tourists when there are thousands of better applicants waiting, jobless, to do a better job? 2. Why roster only a single person to be in the chain bay when there should be at least four people rostered on, for opening weekend? 3. Why put up an abrasive notice on your website ""we do not have a chain fitting service this year"" when it is opening weekend after months of lockdown and the industry needs desperately to impress tourists? 4. Why charge so much for lift passes if you can't even hire or roster enough staff for basic health and safety? 5. Why risk losing your Tourism NZ license for rude and arrogant behaviour towards tourists who are trying desperately to support your enterprise? I cannot believe that the local Chamber of Commerce, local Mayors and members of parliament can continue to support The Renarkabkes Ski Fields unless radical changes are made and apologies given to tourists. Remember, tourists are gold. Treat us with a bit more respect!"
2020,Jun,"This place lives up to its reputation as one of the best ski fields in New Zealand. Good variety of track difficulties and terrains. Snow is very reliable throughout winter."
2020,Jan,"A short drive out of Queenstown and you reach the turn off for the Remarkables Ski Area, the drive up is like a Swiss alpine pass, with narrow hair pin turns, and the most amazing views across Lake Wakatipu, Shotover valley, and Queenstown, all across the mountains. It is a bit of a hair raising drive, but well worth the stunning scenery. You can reach the top in around about 45 minutes."
2020,Jan,"The walk up to Lake Alta was a little tough but the patches of ""summer snow"" were enough to keen my kids (from the tropics) entertained with snowball fights. I got super lucky and someone let me take there Stand Up Paddle Board for a spin around the lake. A memory that will last with me forever."
2019,Sep,"Ski'd for 2 days. The shuttle bus trip from Queenstown was an experience in itself, with spectacular views going up the mountain - bus took about 1 hours each way with a few stops for passengers. The mountain was fantastic skiing for moderate to experienced runs, a couple of beginner runs. No queues at all for ski runs, except at the one central restaurant which was very busy and crowded. The mountain was not too windy as it is in a valley so has some protection from the winds."
2019,Oct,"The road to the ski field is scenic but a bid windy. It could be tricky in the icy conditions. It's very handy to use the sky bus service. You can park your car at the ski field car at the bottom of the mountain to use the bus service."
2019,Oct,"Wrong time of year for skiing however we were thrilled to discover that we could still get to the ski field to see real snow, great drive & experience for us"
2019,Oct,"Even though the ski field is close the time we visit, the drive up to the look out area the view from above is so remarkable and the 360 views of queenstown is far away from words can discripe. Too beautiful and too magnificent of the Remarkable Mount."
2019,Oct,"This is not a review about ski but even if you dont go up there to ski, go for the drive itself. Its amazing!! The views from the road all the way up the mountain will have you in awe. I researched all about it before I went so I was prepared for the state of the road which is a little rough in parts, some gravel. I went up in October during good weather and during the winter you would need snow chains. I recommend it just for the experience."
2019,Oct,"A bit of an adrenalin rush on that road, we went out of the skiing season but the views on the way up are huge as good as being in a plane."
2019,Oct,"It was our first ski experience at the Remarkables. We went on a package deal with 2 lessons and ski gear 9boots, skis, jacket, pants, googles and gloves). Very hard work but it was a great experience. Definitely worth a visit when you are in Queenstown."
2019,Oct,"wow what a remarkable resort especially the drive up the mountain what a view. You can see the whole city from above and look down on the helicopters."
2019,Oct,"Staff were all helpful and it's a great beginners area, plenty of room. Kids and I went snowboarding for the first time. Instructor was great and the facilities are great too. We could leave our rental gear overnight for free which made things easy for us. Food was good, hot chocolate was better:)"
2018,June,"A good family resort, however $3.50 for a fluffy (baby chino) is too expensive itâ€™s a tiny bit of milk in an expresso cup and 2 small marshmallows. The coffeeâ€™s were a normal price around $5 so why charge so much for a fluffy for young kids."
2021,Jul,"After skiing all week we went up for a lesson and afternoon ski. We arrived at midday and got our tickets and were ready for fittings of performance rentals at 12.20pm. The next hour was a nightmare with the staff at the counter going on breaks to leave one person to deal with logging people in and fitting us for ski, boots etc. we were the only ones needing to be served. That took 40 mins then we got on the mountain to find the bindings weren’t correct went back down to again take another 30 mins which started to eat into a lesson we’d booked. After spending $641 for two people with only 2 hours left you’d think they could provide a better service. This place is expensive for what it is. A sandwich for $10 was inedible and the cafe is ridiculously expensive for very average food. The staff are all nice but it’s not run well with little things like no refill for tomato sauce after paying $7 for a meat pie and tables not cleaned regularly. They really need to get it together because it just feels like a money grab."
2021,Jun,"The staff at the Remarkable Ski Area went out of their way to help us - beyond expectation in fact. Their customer service is highly commended (overhearing the manager dealing with another customer who was challenging). Special mention to Isaac who did all he could to make sure our visit was pleasant. Thank you to the management team for their work and flexibility behind the scenes to rectify an error."
2021,Jun,"Huge shoutout to our instructor Brigit who looked after us so well all day! We took part in the First Timers Starter Package, and Brigit was with us every step of the way. She was kind, passionate, and above all, patient. Even though we were in a group with eight others, Brigit gave us all personalised feedback and really looked out for each and every one of us!"
2020,Mar,"We were driven around in a massive group with AATKings and the views were stunning. Beautiful blue Lake Wakatipu surrounded by Remarkables mountain range."
2020,Sep,"Returning after 4 years, pleased to find a fantastic new cafe. 2 servery ends with basic lunchbar food at 1 end & a gourmet style servery at the other end. Prices are expensive eg sushi $20! Burgers more affordable and well presented. Outside theres a double magic carpet that goes up to another single magic carpet. The left side has the new Sugar Bowl 6 seater chairlift that is super comfy & fast. The ski runs are easy with a couple of blue runs along the way. For the more adventurous the right side has the Shadow Basin with more of the same plus a traverse to some powder runs & blue/black runs. Only downside is that you end up near carpark 4 and have to take wait for the shuttle to get back. Carpark tip - go right to the top and if lucky you can find a spare park otherwise you're at the mercy of the shuttle at 30 minute intervals. Beware queuing up if you don't have any skis as those that load their skis into the back of the bus then form another queue closer to the bus and seem to jump the normal queue."
2020,Jul,"The road up is long and slow with parking a bus trip away with a long line for the bus. Not too keen on the ski area as it was quite narrow with way to many people on it. . I found the other ski fields to be better."
2020,Jul,"Good rental gear, quick lift waits and a good range of terrain. If your lucky enough to get fresh snow the off trail potential looks stunning. The road up was well kept with spectacular views. There was a good range of food and drinks including alcohol available. A quick climb up to the look out is well worth it. Only small criticism is that is too hot in the rental area when you have all your gear on."
2020,Jul,"We went up for a look yesterday in the full winter sun and ended up hiring all the gear, booking a lesson and enjoying the whole afternoon on the snow. It was our first time up the Remarkables and kudos to the guy who served us. If it hadn't been for his friendly professional approach, we might not have stayed."
2020,Jul,"Great fun, lots of space that caters for all skillsets, 10/10 views of the many snowy ranges around queenstown! Food is very over priced, take snacks lol"
2020,Jul,"we went skiing here in the past holidays. I had a Lesson with Ross James he was awesome. Also I did skiing in a sit ski. I like the new Lodge."
2020,Jul,"We tried to arrive daily at 8am to get a top car park. The variety of ski runs for a beginner/intermediate is excellent. Queues form quickly at the travellator for the beginners run. Cafe had plenty of food, ran out of mulled wine 😣."
2020,Oct,"My partner and I are both near-beginner skiers and we had an awesome day with Alan, an English ski instructor. We were put in a small group of 5 and it is fair to say that I learnt more in less than 4 hours than the sum total of previous ski trips. He was extremely patient and friendly. His progressions helped build up our levels of confidence and by the end of the lesson, I could ski on one leg. Lots of good easy ski areas for beginners. The coach trip was incredible with amazing views. Thank you to SnowBizz for the equipment hire. I recommend that you get your gear the day before rather than wait until you are up the mountain."
2020,Oct,"We spent an amazing day at remakrables just after a major snowstorm the day was perfect no wind it was warm tonnes of fresh snow, the snow centre was very helpful as were the staff from pick up at the centre on the mountain. Such an awesome day out kids and I loved and will be something we will do again for many years to come"
2020,Sep,"I love this ski field, always lots of interesting trails to ski, loving the new Sugar Bowl chairlift, has opened up loads more of the mountain, never disappoints"
2020,Sep,"First time to The Remarkables, only been to Coronet peak. Well laid out, lots of lockers and the skiers seem to fly through the lifts. We got a private one on one lesson for our son who hadnt skied before and whilst it seems a bit expensive it was well worth it. After his lesson he was away with all the confidence in the world. We also took the snow bus up....so much easier than taking your own car and they drop you right at the door. Will def come back."
2020,Sep,"We had a great day on the mountain with the kids aged 5 and 7 going to the Kia club. The staff had great energy and were super friendly to our two shy girls. Meantime as a beginner I headed to the green runs and had a blast. Lunch time and the queues were fine and we got a table for some lunch. All staff onsite were really friendly and nice but I have to say the teachers at Ski school stood out just at how friend they all were and encouraging to the kids. Can’t wait to come back"
