2021,August,"We absolutely loved it up at Coronet Peak "
2021,August,"We love Coronet Peak √¢‚Ç¨¬¶.everything about it however there is one person who is an absolute stand out. Each day when we catch the shuttle we always end up getting a ride with Ash. Talk about positive and exceeding the customer expectations√¢‚Ç¨¬¶.Ash does it every time. We think he is amazing cheers Andrew and Kyleigh Hoggard"
2021,August,"Thank you so much Maddy! Excellent instructor, couldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t believe I actually completed so much on my second day skiing with your help. Would highly recommend her if you need an instructor. √∞≈∏Àú≈Ω"

2018,August,"Did the one day beginners course today snowboarding and loved it! No matter how bad you were the teacher would go as far as he needed with you to make sure you were sweet and safe our teacher Joshua was awesome and explained what to do and how to do it so well. Thanks for a great day! Depending how our bodies feel tomorrow we may be back for another day before we depart  √Ø¬ø¬Ω can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t wait to try it again!"
2018,July,"I am a non-skier... it was my first time seeing snow, and my partner asked if it was possible for us to go up the ski lift to √¢‚Ç¨≈ìlook√¢‚Ç¨¬ù. Not only was it possible, it only cost $30 per person, plus $5 to hire some snow boots (you must wear protective footwear). The staff were amazing  - so helpful and non-judgemental, friendly and kind. And the view from the viewing platform at the peak was unbelievable! I would thoroughly recommend this wonderful place! Even to non-skiers!!"
2018,June,"How good was that launch party. Cheers coronet for creating and epic night last night! Bring on many more! √Ø¬ø¬Ω√Ø¬ø¬Ω"
2017,November,"Great trip up November 17. Snow has all gone however views are amazing √∞≈∏Àú‚Ä∞ and road in super condition sealed all the way"
2017,September,"My 1st time ever in montain skiing. So i give 5 stars"
2017,September,"Great staff, fantastic facilities, the coolest and most knowledgeable instructors, the food is awesome, and were coming back next year!"
2017,September,"All the staff I met and interacted with were amazing, patient and humorous.  Thank you for an awesome experience!"
2017,September,"Nice place, good coach "
2021,Aug,"Went for a lesson and was blown away to see the most stunningly handsome instructor of my life. Luckily I had goggles on or I might have been blinded by the immense beauty of Hugo Huntington. He managed to get me from pizza to hitting XL features in one lesson! Not sure if it was the skiing or his enthusiasm and charisma that has left me weak at the knees."
2021,Aug,"We had such an amazing day on the mountain with Elle. Elle was our instructor who took us from Beginners to Winners in just a few hours."
2021,Jul,"Great visit up the gondola - for non-skiers this was a great experience. We were able to walk around and climb part way up to the weather station. Great views"
2021,Jun,"Was one good beginners run. Good for all skill sets, the snow was quite icy. A wonderful look out at the top, of endless snowy mountains"
2021,Jun,"Coronet peak is a fantastic ski field, they have modern cutting edge infrastructure."
2021,Jul,"Having Tom Chandler as our personal ski instructor was the best thing we could have done. We were ski and snow novices (family of 4 all at varied skill levels) but his friendly, down to earth approach gave us confidence in ourselves to try new things and not to give up. His experience and knowledge definitely helped us so much so, that we booked another day with him."
2021,Jul,"A wonderful ski locations. Plenty of trails. My wife and I had a fantastic time. I would suggest bringing your own food though. As with all ski destinations, food and drink is not cheap."
2020,Mar,"We were driven in a huge group with AATKings around Coronet Peak and the views were stunning from a distance."
2020,Jul,"We went during the school holidays in July so it was fairly busy as is expected. Having said that, lots of fun on the snow. Great for everyone including those that are new to skiing or snowboarding. There is a dedicated area for those that are learning and if you only plan on staying there then you don't have to pay as much. Access by car was easy (just drive carefully and have snow chains just in case)."
2021,Jan,"Oh my gosh what wasn‚Äôt enjoy. We did a gondola/pizza deal on Bookme. What a great value."
2020,Dec,We went up in December. Nice drive up and a easy hike up the hill with the kids. Amazing views. Definitely coming back for a winter hit"
2020,Sep,"Love to ski here, always a good leg work out with loads of great runs. spectacular views of Queenstown and a great atmosphere."
2020,Sep,"It‚Äôs really fun up at coronet peak, but experience wasn‚Äôt great this time around, the ski instructor Tony was very rude, and impatient."
2020,Sep,"Having never being skiing before my friends purchased passes whilst I had a 4 hour beginner lesson. I had Paula as my instructor and she was patient, encouraging and persistent. We met at 10:30 and started off by learning how to move/stop/start in skiis. Once everyone felt comfortable we started on the magic carpet and doing short, easy runs. Paula had eyes on everyone on the group and easily saw everyone‚Äôs ability levels and adapted accordingly. A member of our group had an accident and it was dealt with professionally and swiftly. Amazing value for money and I even faced my greatest fear of heights and went on the chair lift. A full day of skiing with a fantastic instructor. Big shout out and thank you to Paula!"
2020,Sep,"Have had five amazing days at Coronet Peak over the last few weeks."
2020,Aug,"A spur of the moment mountain drive to check out the snow and the view. Accomplished in a 2 wheel drive Toyota car"
2020,Aug,"Worth flying to the South Island for this really enjoyable skiing. Much netter value and with a more guaranteed quality of experience than in the North Island"
2020,Aug,"After having our day at Cardrona cancelled due to the start of Level 2 restrictions, we opted instead to all just sled at Coronet. The slowest part of the day was getting the required MyPass cards to access the field, but after that, the snow play area was small and quiet, and a lot of fun. Highly recommend."
2020,Aug,"We had a great day on the snow. The staff are very helpful. We had lift pass, lessons and gear hire as a package. It's an expensive day but well worth the experience."
2020,Aug,"Awesome hill for skiing with young kids (9 and 4) lots of Blue terrain that is confidence inspiring and the central chair makes life easy. The ski creche is awesome and our four year old loved it while also learning some skiing."
2020,Aug,"The ""dedicated snow play area"" was very poor. Not much use to families who just want to enjoy the snow.. The toboggan was expensive at $30 and the toboggan slope wasnt steep enough you couldnt get enough momentum up to get a good run. Wouldnt recommend it. Try Snow Farm instead for tubing - cheaper and friendlier staff The lady who sold us the ticket for the taboggan was on her mobile as we walked in. Not a good look"
2020,Jul,"Both me and the teens love skiing here, just the right amount of space and slope to make the day enjoyable. School holidays in July are always a test but this place copes well."
2020,Aug,"Great day skiing. No Aussies boarding out of control with ridiculous faux rooster hats. How nz skiing used to be before the descendants of chicken thieves discovered usüòÄ"
2020,Jul,"Fab day on the slopes with awesome snow conditions. Night skiing was on my bucket list and it didn't disappoint!"
2020,Jul,"We enjoyed 4 days skiing at this resort. The snow and fields were excellent. The chair crew were fairly good at moving the queues efficiently. What wasn‚Äôt great was the wait times for coffee and food. They did their best to cope with a high volume of customers but from this customers‚Äô viewpoint the wait was too long, the space allocated to customers waiting wasn‚Äôt adequate and the crew behind the counter were struggling for space to make drinks etc. I‚Äôd like to suggest a table device which rings when your order is ready. That would eliminate the crowds inside the doorway blocking the thoroughfare."
2020,Jul,"Yesterday I had my first experience of skiing, taking advantage of the excellent value package for adult beginners."
2020,Jul,"My 13 year old daughter and I aren't snowboarders or skiers but we still had a fabulous time sightseeing. We got a gondola pass and the view from on top of the mountain was stunning. The staff at the counter were super helpful and friendly and everything was run safely and professionally. It's a really nice ski field."
2020,Jul,"We visited second week of opening. The area is well organised and all employees very knowledgeable and helpful. We paid for gandola, ski rental, lift pass, bus ride at the snow center. The bus goes every half hour, very punctual. The ride was smooth but you can take your car, check website for update. The snow centre guys were very helpful. We saw good amount of local NZ residents but I would say the right amount, not over crowded. Lunch service is awesome, and price is ok."
2019,Aug,"We had an awesome visit up here in August 2019. We were traveling with our 4 year old daughter and didn‚Äôt want to pay for a full snow/ski experience with lift passes and equipment etc. We were staying in queenstown and drove up here in our motorhome (keeping an eye on the weather info, didn‚Äôt need chains) we just paid for toboggan and snow play which was perfect for us - daughter got to experience snow (it was snowing the day we were there) and play snowballs and toboggan and it was an easy and fun day out for us. Highly recommend if you want some snow play but not a full on snow/ski experience!!"
2020,Mar,"This was a short drive from town, a windy road with some fabulous views at the top. Have some coffee, enjoy. Or go parasailing or crazy gondola/road biking if you like. Or ski. But we just hung out for about half an hour."
2020,Mar,"A must for all. The luge, views, food staff was great. If you go to Queenstown and do not go to the park then you have missed one of the best. Go during the week no queues. Greta walk down and the kids ran up the next day."
2020,Mar,"It can be windy and cold, so dress for it, but the views are worth the trip up on a clear day. Its also interesting to watch the hang and para gliders take off and soar over the valley. The peak gondola is also apparently open for sightseeing but I didn't choose to use it."
2020,Mar,"It is an amazing place with stunning views! I definitely recommend it! The coffee shop at the base building offers real taste food, specially when served by Elena, a very friendly attendant always with a smile on her face!"
2020,Mar,"Did this in the summer. Awesome views from top after trip up in Gondola and then walked down from the top."
2020,Mar,"The view was awesome & we were lucky to watch paragliders taking off below us. The only down side was the chair lift was open & operating but we were there at 9am & the lady running the chairlift said that the toilets arent unlocked till 11am ??"
2020,Feb,"Stopped here whilst travelling between Arrowtown and Queenstown. The peak is about 8km from the main highway obviously up a steep surfaced road. During winter it's a ski area and in the summer it is used as a bike track or viewing area. At the end of the road, from the car park, there is a ski/bike lift and a short hike to they very top. There are various grades of bike tracks as there are for skiing. By the car park there is a cafe and bike repair accessories shop. The view from the car park is superb. You can see Queenstown, the lake and airport besides watching the take off area for paragliding and parascending trips. Well worth the effort to get there."
