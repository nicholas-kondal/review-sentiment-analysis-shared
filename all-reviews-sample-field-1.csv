2021,October,yeah do big ski jump
2022,March,Went up on the Chondola sightseeing and had some spectacular views in a beautiful day.
2022,June,"After skiing in countries such as Japan and Australia, I can say with some certainty there is something odd here at Cadrona. On entering, we followed signs towards the main office, but after being ushered to a lower car park we ended up walking 200 metres in ski gear. The ticket office was hard to find when we finally arrived. Again at lunchtime, we had trouble finding the cafeteria and amenities. No scenic views from the cafe- we were in a black box! Enjoyed my day, a good run and friendly staff but I had to say there's some poor management with the journey to and from facilities. In terms of the facilities, the alpine experience is lost. Better parking and signage systems are needed. Very disorientating. three stars"
2021,July,"Great ski field, staff are friendly!"
2022,March,"Rental process was a cinch, staff are great, helpful and knowledgeable. Snow was ...snowy !"

2021,November,We came as a group to do the Karting. What a hoot!!!! Soooo much fun!!!
2021,July,"Top facilities, helpful team in the rentals and ticketing. We had a brilliant day up there despite the not so brilliant weather. So nice that it was quite quiet, it felt like we had the mountain to ourselves."
2022,March,Only was on the learners area but loved every second. Very helpful staff and good food at the noodle bar
2022,April,the snow is icy so when you're skiing your legs and skis vibrate and its quite uncomfortable
2021,July,Best ski field in NZ. Great dining options + facilities. They've handled the covid restrictions brilliantly + should be commended for this as its not an easy task in some parts of a ski resort. Highly recommend.
2021,September,"Bryannah looking after the apartments was amazing! We are locals to Wanaka but wanted to stay the night to make our visit extra special.  We were SO WELL LOOKED AFTER by everyone we encountered."
2021,September,"The apartment team have cancelled our annual booking as Australianâ€™s want the apartment next year. Why do Australian tourists have priority over New Zealanders?"
2021,August,"I wanted to send a big shout out to one of your snow board instructors Leonie. She ran my sons Low Riders group and was absolutely amazing. She managed to gain and retain the kids focus, built a gorgeous connection with them and my son came on leaps and bounds in his skill level. To top it all off Leonie kindly found and returned to me a lost helmet and gloves which I accidentally left on the bus.  Talk about going over and above!!"
2021,July,"I booked a 2 hour private lesson  on my visit to Cardrona because it had been 20 years since I had been on a Snowboard. I feel very lucky to have had Leonie as my instructor because she was not only able to help me regain my confidence and sharpen my techniques, but her detailed knowledge of the mountain and itsâ€™ runs was invaluable in the cloud covered (fogged) conditions. She knew every bump and ledge, I felt safe throughout my entire lesson and I would recommend her to anyone."
2020,August,"Despite the challenges caused by Covid the team have been great with very quick communication and customer centric approach. Thank you for a great customer experience."
2020,August,"Last day staying here and it's been great. Spectacular views and first in the queue.  Thank you to the house keeping team for looking after us. Definitely looking forward to staying here again."
2020,September,"Hey Team, My kids had a fantastic experience this week with Dylan in the Lowriders 4 day snowboarding sessions! Also had an amazing experience in The Mezz cafe yesterday & today with the only guy in there (eek didnâ€™t get his name) he was exceptional first class ðŸ‘Œ"
2021,July,"Rachel gave my 3 year old a wonderful ski lesson this morning. She took the time to find out his favorite things so she could make his lesson fun + enjoyable. Would 100% recommend.  Thanks again Rachel."
2021,July,"I had an awesome experience at Cardrona, and would highly recommend snowboarding lessons with Leonie. She was a fantastic coach, with practical tips and constructive advice that helped me to improve my technique and master the chairlift. Canâ€™t wait for another season!"
2021,July,"Fantastic help yesterday from Claire in rentals. She helped one of our party adjust boots that were not even rented there. We were willing to rent new boots but she took out her tools and adjusted ours for free. Thatâ€™s great customer service. Thanks!"
2020,December,"Have been her twice over 2 years have loved both times. Slooesbreally good for each level. Plenty of slabs to ski. Staff are friendly and accommodating to needs. Great they support adaptive snow sport too which make them accessible to more consumers!"
2020,August,"Staying in the Cardrona Apartments and sadly leaving soon. Highly recommend staying here. Incredibly convenient, first up the mountain and spectacular views.  Special shout out to the amazing housekeeping staff who have gone above and beyond to look after us! Our thanks to Sarah and all the team. Also my personal thanks to the friendly staff in the medical centre, especially Elaine the physiotherapist. We have loved our stay here!!!"

2018,August,"Best customer service I've experienced in NZ!"
2018,July,"I just want to say a massive thank you to the under 5's ski team (instructors and desk staff) who have been so accommodating in making our 4 year old learn to ski with ease. You all go out of your way to make skiing fun for the kids, from they way you speak to them, get them ready and have snow fun. We will defiantly back as I now have two kids hooked on Cardrona."
2018,July,"Sweeeeeeeeet"
2018,July,"A massive shout out to James (orange cardrona jacket) and also Adam from the ticket office, who went above and beyond to help me locate my 'missing' board! You made my day. Excellent staff all round at Cardrona! 5stars."
2018,July,"We loved learning to ski at Cardrona! Massive thanks to the staff who were all so fantastic! Special thanks to the kids instructors - Matt and Iain. "
2018,May,"I have been skiing here most years since Cardrona first opened. After all of these years (well decades actually)  Cardrona has not lost it's friendliness and charm. I never get tired of just cruising around, saying hello to old (Chris Reilly, Groomer, Mike Roberts) and new friends, soaking up the stunning views. One thing I miss, however, are the ""toasties"". Please bring them back. The other ski areas in the region all have their pluses but Cardrona has always focused on friendly staff and facilitating skiers of all levels to have a great skiing experience. Thank you Cardrona team."
2017,November,"I cannot rate this place highly enough. Cardrona WE  LOVE YOU!"
2017,September,"We spent 3 nights in an apartment at Cardrona. Everything was awesome. Before we even arrived, the communication was excellent - there was a land slip on the Crown Range and we were sent regular email updates on the state of the road. They checked our arrival time, to make sure we were safe dealing with chains - there are staff waiting to help those who need it. When we checked in, we were given all the information we needed in regards to equipment rental & lessons & we were shown to our room - not just pointed in the right direction. All the staff were friendly & helpful - check in, rental, cafes & those on the lifts. Our ski instructor, Tim, was awesome. Very helpful & encouraging. We had a great few days, and would love to come back again sometime."
2017,September,"Perfect powdery snow! Awesome place for family fun!"
2017,September,"Best mountain in NZ!  Exceptional size, and beautiful snow!  Why go anywhere else!"
2017,September,"The best ski field in QT."
2017,September,"I freaking love this place!! We came here a few weeks ago. I was a first time skiier and the instructors were awesome. Very supportive as I had a fall in another ski park that day and had lost confidence. The instructors there helped me get through this emotional feeling of ""i cant do this!""  a few days afte we came back and i conquered my first time on the chairlift and did about rounds 20 of the skyline section - an amazing breathaking view i couldnt help it. I love that at one point i took a green trail and somehow ended up on the blue to a little pub in the middle of the ski slopes, that was amazing too.. parked our skis, had a drink and came back and continued to ski to the bottom."
2017,August,"Had the best 3 days learning to snowboard! The instructors were so friendly and helpful! Props to Melanie and Hamish ï¿½ï¿½ just gotta send it"
2017,July,"Absolutely awesome ski field... My 5yr old daughter had her first ever ski lesson, instructor called Wanaka was amazing."
2017,July,"Hallo, me and my 6 yr old been school skiing today, i was thinking yesterday it will be called off after watching weather forecast, but it was ok in the morning to go up with 3cm snowfall forecast on the day. I just wish somebody made a call after lunch for early finish and try to get people down after most if the day snowing . But my son still had great time on the slope and very late in the arvo we made it down safely. Just think of all mothers to do best for kids to have snow experience and maybe push couch/bus travel from bottom of skifield.  Thank you;-)"
2017,July,"Awesome snow at Cardrona . New Chondola makes windy days a breeze ..."
2017,July,"What an amazing place. Perfect for the whole family and all levels of skiing. We had 2 group lessons with J today and he was amazing. So patient and a helpful hand we I fell (which was a few times). Kids Club is great also my daughter loved it. We will be back!!"
2017,July,"Wow the cost ski-ing is ðŸ˜„ But I will say the staff are amazing always smiling and you can have a great laugh with them from the crazy girl waving at the bottom car park as you enter to the a fabulous man who helped me look for my daughter gloves and the great Texas guy who found me the most comfortable boots after complaining about the last 3 boots I  tried. The ski  instructors  Were great too."
2017,July,"Top class the staff are super helpful and friendly. Nothing is a problem. We left one of our passes at home and we had it replaced with no fuss within minutesðŸ˜€."
2017,July,"Such a busy day up there yesterday and all the staff were so calm and cheerful and just amazing. Beautiful day! Loved it.  Looking forward to another day there today."

2017,July,"A better alpine experience than Coronet Peak by far. Higher elevation brings better snow, broad skiing area, the gondola ""chondola"" lets non skiers go up the mountain, and a good first timers slope. "
